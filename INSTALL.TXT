This is a short HOWTO for compiling the application from source code.

QWatch is standard QT application, compilation can be generally achieved by invoking commands

qmake
make

in the source folder directory.
It should create binary executable files under ./build directory.

LINUX:
- following packages have to be installed to compile QT application: libqt4-dev (version 4.5+), build-essential
- in adition, libraries for Alsa development are required to compile qwatch: libasound2-dev
- aplication uses "verdana" and "arial black" fonts to display strings, for these fonts install: msttcorefonts

Windows:
- install QT development SDK from www.qtsoftware.com (OpenSource)
- build using QTCreator or command line
- default QT configuration builds application dynamically - it will depend on QT .dlls and mingwm10.dll, but you can avoid
  this by reconfiguring Qt to build in statically. See Qt documentation.
